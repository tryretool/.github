    <description>Anonymous Apex script to execute. Your script must include a method definition for `void execute( List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; sourceRecordsBatch )`, which will be passed the current batch of source records. Your script is invoked once per batch just like the `execute` method of a Batchable class. Unlike a Batchable class, no state is preserved within the script between executions.</description>
