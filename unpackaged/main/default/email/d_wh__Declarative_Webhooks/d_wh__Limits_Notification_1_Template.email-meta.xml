    <subject>Notification: Approaching Declarative Webhooks Calls Limit</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi!


We hope this email finds you well. We are reaching out to notify you that you are approaching your monthly limit for outbound or inbound calls.


As per our records, you have utilized 80% of your allowed number of calls for the current month. Once you reach your limit, you will not be able to make any additional calls until next month.


To avoid any disruption in your service, we recommend upgrading to a higher tier plan before hitting the limit. If you feel like you are unlikely to hit your call limit this month, please ignore this notification.


If you have any questions or concerns, please don&#39;t hesitate to reach out to our customer support team, and we will be happy to assist you.


Thank you for choosing Declarative Webhooks for your Salesforce integration needs!
