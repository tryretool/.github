Hi there!

<p>Thanks for reaching out about your use case with Retool. As this email is primarily dedicated to Account and Billing questions, I can suggest checking out our <a href="https://retool.com/templates/"  target="_blank">Templates page</a> to see if any of our ready-made templates match your use case.  I also suggest that you check out our <a href="http://community.retool.com/" target="_blank">Community Forum</a> and see if there are similar use cases there and if not, team members in our <a href="https://community.retool.com/t/come-join-retool-office-hours-now-in-discord/12348" target="_blank">Office Hours</a> can greatly assist you! ​</p>

<p>We’ve noticed that topics that include the following get more quality responses with shorter response times: </p>
<ul>
<li>A detailed title and clear description of the problem</li>
<li>Screenshots, recordings and/or code snippets of any of the following that apply:</li>
<ul>
<li>browser console</li>
<li>logs</li>
<li>error messages</li>
<li>related components and configuration</li>
</ul></ul>

<p>Here is an example of a well-written post that was easily understood and as a result received a swift response: <a href="https://community.retool.com/t/bulk-inserting-to-db-from-checkbox-group/42333" target="_blank">https://community.retool.com/t/bulk-inserting-to-db-from-checkbox-group/42333</a></p>
