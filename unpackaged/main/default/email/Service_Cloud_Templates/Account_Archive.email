Please see this documentation for how you, or an Admin in your Retool org, <a href="https://docs.retool.com/org-users/guides/archive-cloud-users-or-organizations" target="_blank"/>can manage archiving</a> on your side.

<p>An Admin within your Retool organization can archive their own Retool org in the Settings → Advanced → Archive Org setting. Individual users can archive their own login on the account settings page. </p>

<p>As a security best practice, I’m not able to take these actions on the Retool side.</p>
