Hi {!Contact.FirstName},
<p>There is no way to change the billing admin of a self-hosted Retool instance. The new admin can sign up for a new license key at <a href="https://my.retool.com/" target="_blank">my.retool.com</a>, and subscribe to an equivalent plan level. You can then switch the license keys in your environment variables and reach out to Retool Support via the contact methods mentioned on our <a href="https://docs.retool.com/support" target="_blank">Contact Retool Support</a> page so we can cancel the previous subscription. If you're able to login to the old account on my.retool.com, you can do this yourself by downgrading the old account to a Free plan.</p>
