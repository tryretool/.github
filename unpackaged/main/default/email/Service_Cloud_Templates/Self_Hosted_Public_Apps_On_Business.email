Retool designed this feature to support applications that offer unrestricted access to the public before adding more options to self-host retool. Because self-hosted customers use Retool behind a VPN however, these applications are not truly public and our engineering team pushed a fix to patch this. We’ve also developed some first class feature sets to properly support the use cases we most commonly see, such as Retool Embed and Retool Portals.

That said, if you have a use case we might not be covering, we’d love to work with you! I can connect you with folks from our Sales team to work on making this happen.
