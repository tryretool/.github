With your written approval here, I can have a member of the Retool Support team access your instance from our end and investigate the app in question. If so, can you provide a link to the app?

Please note: You will not have to invite the Retool Support team member. It will come at no additional cost to your org. The Support team member will make a copy of the app in the same folder (if it is in a folder) to maintain the granular permission (this is only if you are on the Business plan) and to avoid changing the app if it is already released for production. 

Let us know!
