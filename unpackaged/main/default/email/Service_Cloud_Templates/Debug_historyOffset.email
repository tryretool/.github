Could you try using the ?_historyOffset=5 parameter at the end of your URL? This will allow you to ""travel back in time"" 5 steps. You can increase the number to go further back in time if you still don't see any app data. The idea here is to go back to the most recent working version so you don't have to redo as much work (going back 1000 steps would likely show data, but it could be many, many changes behind).

***WARNING!*** If you make any changes to the canvas when traveling back in time, that past version will become your present version and it messes with the history, so be careful not to touch anything! Once you find a version that isn't crashing and you'd like to make that your present version, then you can make an edit to the canvas (move a component, add a component, etc) to persist that view.
