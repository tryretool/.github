Thank you for trying Retool. 

<p>Please have an admin archive the account by following <a href="https://docs.retool.com/org-users/guides/cloud/archive-cloud-users-or-organizations" target="_blank" >this</a> guide, and I have filed the data deletion request for your organization so your org will no longer be in the system. If you change your mind in the future, youâ€™ll have to sign up for a new Retool organization. We appreciate you giving Retool a chance, and best of luck going forward!</p>
