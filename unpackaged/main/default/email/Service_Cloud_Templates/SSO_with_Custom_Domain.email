<p>We recommend continuing the discussion about this technical question/issue report by bringing it to the <a href="https://community.retool.com/t/retool-community-guidelines/30917" target="_blank">Developer Community Forums</a>, <a href="https://community.retool.com/t/come-join-retool-office-hours-now-in-discord/12348" target="_blank">live video office hours</a>, or in our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/retool" target="_blank">Discord Server</a> where Retool employees including our Community Support Engineers and Engineers actively respond. We’re very excited about our work over the last year establishing a highly active Developer Community managed by our Community Support Engineers who are dedicated to providing guidance on the forum and Office Hours.

<p>Via email, we're unable to provide technical support for this issue because this channel, and my team, is dedicated to account and billing-related inquiries.</p>


<p>Thank you for your understanding!</p>
