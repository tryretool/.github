Thanks for reaching out.

<p>You can downgrade your annual plan in the last month of your annual cycle by following the steps in <a href="https://docs.retool.com/support/downgrade-plan#downgrade-an-annual-plan-renewal" target="_blank">this</a> article.</p>
<p>I looked into your account and the last month of your cycle begins on this day: ________
If you would like us to downgrade your commitment, we can do it but it would take effect immediately and we would be unable to provide a prorated refund for your remaining time.</p>

<p>Glad to answer further questions. </p>
