    <textOnly>Thanks again for the feedback! I went ahead and filed a feature request for this. While I donâ€™t have an exact timeline right now, you can follow the Retool Changelog/Release Notes for product updates to see if and when this gets implemented.
I&#39;ll go ahead and close out this ticket now, but please reach out to Retool Support if anything else comes up.</textOnly>
