Hi {!Contact.FirstName} -
 
Thanks for letting us know that you're still trying to resolve that Community topic! The next best thing to do would be to comment on the Community topic itself. A new comment will bring the topic back into the spotlight for other Community members to see.

Any new activity will push the topic up to the top of the forum's front page under "Latest" topics, making it more visible to the Retool experts from the Community or the Retool team. We've seen comments like "I'm still stuck on this. Any ideas from the community on a solution or workaround here?" work really well. Also, if you have extra details like screenshots, logs, error messages, or what you've already tried, adding them might help others see what you're dealing with.

Thanks for your understanding!
