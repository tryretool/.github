Hi there -

Thank you for reaching out. I took a look at your account and it looks like although you were successfully added to our Startup Program, there was a bug in our workflow that did not successfully add the $25,000 to your account. I just went in and manually added your credits, issued you a refund for your invoice, and debited the amount of the invoice from your credits. Please wait 3-5 business days for that to be reflected in your billing method on file.

If you would like to check to see how many credits you have remaining, you can see this in Settings > Billing at the bottom of the screen.
