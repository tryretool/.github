<p>Thanks again for the feedback! I went ahead and filed a feature request for this. While I don&rsquo;t have an exact timeline right now, you can follow the <a href="https://docs.retool.com/changelog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retool Changelog</a> and <a href="https://docs.retool.com/releases/stable#release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Release Notes</a> for product updates to see if and when this gets implemented.<br>I'll go ahead and close out this ticket now, but please reach out to Retool Support if anything else comes up. &#128588;</p>
