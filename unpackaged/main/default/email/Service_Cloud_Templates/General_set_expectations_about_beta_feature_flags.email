Just to set expectations a bit, in general, beta flags like this one are features that are still in development. In this particular case, we don't have a timeline for releasing this feature out of beta into general availability. While we strive never to make a change that would break existing apps for our customer, the beta designation is meant to set expectations that this is still in development and not widely used, so there may be fringe scenarios that haven't been accounted for yet. Even so, if issues come up, let us know and we will triage just like any other existing feature.
