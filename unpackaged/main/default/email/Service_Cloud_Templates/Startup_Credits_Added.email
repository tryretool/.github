Hi there!

<p>Thanks for writing in and confirming that detail. I just added $25,000 in Startup Credits to your account. You should be good to go in selecting a monthly plan to upgrade! (Please note that these credits expire in 1 year.)</p>

<p>After upgrading, you can check on your remaining credits at the bottom of the screen in <b>Settings > Billing.</b></p>

<p>Happy building 🛠️</p>
